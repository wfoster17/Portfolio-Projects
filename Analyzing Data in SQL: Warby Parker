Warby Parker Analyzing Data in SQL. Dataset was aquired through Code Academy. 

-- 1. View Table 'survey'
 SELECT *
 FROM survey
 LIMIT 10;

 -- 2. Number of responses for each question
 -- Q1. 500
 -- Q2. 475
 -- Q3. 380
 -- Q4. 361
 -- Q5. 270
 SELECT question, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
 FROM survey
 GROUP BY question;

-- 3. Survey completion percentages
  -- Q1. 500 = 100%
  -- Q2. 475 = 95%
  -- Q3. 380 = 80%
  -- Q4. 361 = 95%
  -- Q5. 270 = 75%
  -- We see a significant percentage drop off at Q3     (What shapes do you like?) and Q5 (When was your last eye exam)
    -- Quesiton 3 reasoning: The number of different options for frame styles could be causing customers to get confused, or unsure of what whould look good on their face, and no longer proceed with the survey. 
    -- Question 5 reasoning: It might be safe to assume that most people do not go to the eye doctor once a year. This would cause most people to have no idea as to when their last exam was. Even people who do go to the doctor yearly, unless it was in the past month or so, do not remember when exactly they last went. In order to answer this question accurately, people are going to have to leave the survey and check another source for the information, and are less likely to come back and finish the survey. 

-- 4. Home Try On Funnel. 3 paris or 5 pairs most likey to purchase? Datasets used listed below.
